### Identify classes from requirements  

* Analyse business problems  
* Look for nouns in requirements to identify classes and properties of classes    
* Look at verbs to identify methods of classes  
* Think about how time might affect your classes and members  
* Pillars of OOP  
  * Abstraction  
  * Encapsulation: allows interaction of classes without classes knowing about the details of other classes.  
    * Data hiding: protects data  
    * Implementation hiding: allows to change methods without having to change other parts of code
